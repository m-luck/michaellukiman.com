            Deep Lip Reading
        </h3>
        <p>
            A new machine learning experiment,
            deep lip reading combines both computer vision models
            and natural language processing to predict speech.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a dataset which has self-referencing transcriptions, we can train a vision network to recognize utterances and construct words.
            Concatenating output of next-word prediction from GPT2, we can have the network take advantage of semantic insights to improve its overall prediction.
